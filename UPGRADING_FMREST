 Notes on upgrading from fmrest < 0.15
=======================================

There's a breaking change in the way the `.query` method behaves when chained.

Previously it would add new conditions as a logical OR in relation to
already set ones, whereas now by default it adds new conditions as a logical
AND relative to existing ones. To keep the old behavior you can use `.or.query`
in chained query calls instead. See documentation on querying for details.

 Notes on upgrading from fmrest < 0.13
=======================================

From v0.13 onward fmrest becomes a wrapper for two other gems: fmrest-core and
fmrest-spyke.

If you're using FmRest::Spyke::Base in your project then you no
longer need to explicitly include spyke in your Gemfile, as it's now a hard
dependency of fmrest-spyke.

If you're not using FmRest::Spyke::Base and just want to use the Faraday
connection you may want to change your Gemfile to depend on fmrest-core
instead, to avoid including spyke as an useless dependency in your project.

=======================================
 Notes on upgrading from fmrest < 0.12
=======================================

There's a small breaking change in fmrest 0.12 that will most likely not affect
you, but you may want to be aware of:

Previous to this version the record ID on an FmRest::Spyke::Base instance could
be set with `id=`. This caused problems in cases where a FileMaker layout had a
field named `id`, so `id=` got renamed to `__record_id=`. Setting the record ID
by hand however isn't something useful or that should be done at all, so it's
very unlikely that this change will affect your existing code at all.

Thanks for using fmrest-ruby!
