 Notes on upgrading from fmrest < 0.12
=======================================

There's a small breaking change in fmrest 0.12 that will most likely not affect
you, but you may want to be aware of:

Previous to this version the record ID on an FmRest::Spyke::Base instance could
be set with `id=`. This caused problems in cases where a FileMaker layout had a
field named `id`, so `id=` got renamed to `__record_id=`. Setting the record ID
by hand however isn't something useful or that should be done at all, so it's
very unlikely that this change will affect your existing code at all.
